Common Additional Columns:

Normal (nx, ny, nz): These columns might represent the normal vector for each point on the surface of the object. The normal vector indicates the direction perpendicular to the surface at that point. This information is valuable for tasks like recognizing shapes and object segmentation.

Color (r, g, b): If present, these columns could represent the red, green, and blue color values for each point. This information can be useful for tasks that require considering object color for recognition.

Material ID/Label: There might be a column with an integer value or label representing the material the object is made of. This can be helpful for tasks where material properties aid in recognition.

Scalar Fields: Sometimes, additional columns might contain scalar values (single numerical values) associated with each point. These could represent properties like curvature, distance to the object center, or other application-specific features.
